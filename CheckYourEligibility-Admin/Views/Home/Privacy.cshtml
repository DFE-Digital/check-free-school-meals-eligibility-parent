<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>
<p>
    This service is run by the Department of Education.
</p>
<p>
    This means the DfE is the data controller for the <strong>Eligibility Checking Engine</strong> and decides how and why any personal data is processed, including by third parties on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
    We will use the information you give us according to <!--<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter">-->DfE personal information charter.
</p>
<p>
    This privacy policy is relevant to parents and/or guardians using the service, and also to any children you may be
    checking or applying for.
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Personal data standards</h2>
<p>
    To lawfully use your personal data, we need to meet one or more conditions in the data protection legislation.

<p>

        <!--your IP address, and -->details of which version of web browser you use to access the service
    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
    We must have a valid reason to collect your personal data – also known as ‘lawful basis’ under the The Data Protection Act 2018. Our lawful basis is that of 'public task', so that we can run the Entitlement checker as a service to you.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use your data</h2>
<p>
    We will use your personal information to:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        check if you or your child/children are eligible for entitlements such as free school meals
    </li>
    <li>
        send eligibility outcomes to schools in order to register you and your child/children for the possible entitlement
    </li>
    <li>
        send eligibility outcomes to local authorities
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>
<p>
    We keep your personal information for 7 years. After this, it will be securely destroyed. This will usually be 7 years after the end of each contract.
</p> <p>
    This meets legal requirements for the retention of finance data.
</p>
<p>
    When you finish checking you or your child’s entitlement, we'll
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        delete your personal information (unless you give us permission to pass it onto a school and/or local authority)
    </li>
    <li>
        keep audit records of your user account activity for up to 6 years
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can lawfully keep personal data processed purely for research and statistical purposes indefinitely.
