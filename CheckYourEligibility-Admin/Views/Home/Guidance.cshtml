            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Any statements provided must show the parent/guardian’s income and the date it was sent.</p>
            <p>Their latest statement should refer to the month immediately before the date of their request.</p>
            <p>They are entitled if: </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>the take-home pay in their latest Universal Credit statement is <strong>less than £616.67</strong></li>
                <li>the take-home pay for their most recent statement + the one covering the month directly before = less than <strong>£1,233.34</strong> </li>
                <li>the take-home pay from their most recent statement + the one covering the month directly before + the one covering the month directly before that = <strong>less than £1,850.00</strong> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In line with these checks, the annual net earned income of the parent or guardian must be no higher than <strong>£7,400.</strong></p>
            <p>It’s preferable that you conduct all three checks if possible. However, if you don’t have three consecutive Universal Credit statements, you can use any combination of the checks to make a decision. </p>

            <p>When checking an applicant with an asylum support reference number (formerly NASS number), a document proving they are receiving relevant support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 is needed. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a letter from the Home Office</li>
                <li>a visa or student visa</li>
                <li>other kinds of documentation, to be  reviewed at your discretion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the document provided  demonstrates that they receive such support, this is sufficient evidence for them to claim free school meals for their children.</p>
            <p>Note that some asylum seekers with a support reference number are claiming asylum under part IV of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. These claimants are not eligible.</p>
